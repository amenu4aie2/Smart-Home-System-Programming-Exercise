## Exercise Implementation

This project fulfills the requirements of Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 as follows:

### Exercise 1: Design Patterns

We have implemented six different design patterns, demonstrating their practical application in a smart home system:

1. Observer Pattern (Behavioral): Used for notifying system components of device state changes.
2. Command Pattern (Behavioral): Implemented to encapsulate and queue device operations.
3. Factory Method (Creational): Applied for creating different types of smart devices.
4. Singleton (Creational): Ensures a single point of control via the Smart Home Hub.
5. Proxy Pattern (Structural): Provides controlled access to sensitive device operations.
6. Adapter Pattern (Structural): Enables integration of third-party devices with different interfaces.

### Exercise 2: Smart Home System

We have created a comprehensive Smart Home System that includes:

- Device Management: Adding, removing, and controlling various smart devices.
- Task Management: Creating, editing, and tracking tasks.
- Scheduling: Setting up schedules for device operations and tasks.
- Automation: Creating and executing rules based on device states or conditions.
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
- Multi-user Support: Each user has their own devices, tasks, and automation rules.

## Use Cases

Our Smart Home System supports the following key use cases:

1. User can add and control various smart devices (lights, thermostats, door locks).
2. User can create and manage tasks with priorities and deadlines.
3. User can schedule tasks and device operations for future execution.
4. User can set up automation rules to control devices based on specific conditions.
5. User can monitor the status of all connected devices in real-time.
6. System can integrate third-party devices using the Adapter pattern.

## Project Overview

The Smart Home System Simulation is a console-based application that models the functionality of a modern smart home. This project demonstrates the implementation of various software design patterns, object-oriented programming principles, and best practices in software development.

The primary goal is to create a flexible, extensible system that can manage various smart devices within a home environment, showcasing how different design patterns can be used together to solve real-world problems in software architecture.
