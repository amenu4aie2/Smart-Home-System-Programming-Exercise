## Project Overview

The Smart Home System Simulation is a console-based application that models the functionality of a modern smart home. This project demonstrates the implementation of various software design patterns, object-oriented programming principles, and best practices in software development.

The primary goal is to create a flexible, extensible system that can manage various smart devices within a home environment, showcasing how different design patterns can be used together to solve real-world problems in software architecture.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Add, remove, and control various smart devices (lights, thermostats, door locks).
- **Scheduling**: Set up schedules for device operations.
- **Automation**: Create and execute rules based on device states or environmental conditions.
- **Status Monitoring**: View real-time status of all connected devices.
- **Third-party Integration**: Capability to integrate non-standard devices into the system.

## Technology Stack

- Language: TypeScript
- Testing Framework: Jest
- Build Tool: npm

## Architecture

The system is built around a central `SmartHomeHub` that manages all devices and operations. Key components include:

- `SmartDevice`: Base class for all smart devices
- `DeviceFactory`: Creates different types of smart devices
- `Scheduler`: Manages scheduled tasks
- `AutomationEngine`: Handles automation rules
- `Command`: Interface for all device commands

Below is a high-level diagram of the system architecture:

## Design Patterns

This project implements six key design patterns:

1. **Observer Pattern** (Behavioral): For notifying system components of device state changes.
2. **Command Pattern** (Behavioral): To encapsulate and queue device operations.
3. **Factory Method** (Creational): For creating different types of smart devices.
4. **Singleton** (Creational): To ensure a single point of control via the Smart Home Hub.
5. **Proxy Pattern** (Structural): To provide controlled access to sensitive device operations.
6. **Adapter Pattern** (Structural): To integrate third-party devices with different interfaces.
